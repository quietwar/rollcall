# Attendance Assistant


Take attendance using barcode and store and manage data digitally no manual work required,
App completely build on 
[Flutter Framework](https://flutter.io/).
for both Android and iOS.

Teacher captures barcode from student, barcode will be updated every 5 second, once attendance marked Detailed Analysis made and Statics report avaliable even save as xml offine.

The project is not completed yet, To explore flutter framework, I developed a small android application which helps manage attendance data. It is not a complete functioning project, some very basic functionalities have been implemented as an initiative to understand dart programming and flutter architecture.

I would be working more to make the project efficient and nicer and complete as and when time permits.
